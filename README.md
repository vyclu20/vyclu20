I'm a curious and passionate learner with a strong interest in computer science, data science, programming, and digital design. Through various coding and data analysis projects, I've developed skills in Java, Python, Javascript, SQL, and other programming languages including R. I find great satisfaction tackling complex problems and finding elegant solutions through code, and with experience in both backend and frontend development, I enjoy working on projects that require a balance of both skill sets.

I also have a strong proficiency in design tools like Photoshop and Blender, where I focus on creating 3D models and engaging in image manipulation and interactive art. While I have extensive experience using these tools, I'm constantly seeking to improve my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest techniques and trends. Recently, I've been exploring other design tools like Spline to expand my skill set and explore new creative possibilities. 

Overall, I am committed to continuous learning and improvement in all aspects of my work. In the near future, I would like to explore game development and robotics, and further expand my knowledge in artificial intelligence and machine learning. I also have a strong interest in cybersecurity and data privacy, and am eager to explore these fields more deeply.
